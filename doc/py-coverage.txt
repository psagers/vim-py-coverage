py-coverage

==============================================================================
1. About                                                         *py-coverage*

This plugin integrates with Ned Batchelder's code coverage tool for Python
(http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/). After coverage data has been
gathered, this plugin can be used to retrieve the results and present them in
the relevant buffers.

Source lines lacking coverage ("missing") may be indicated by directly
highlighting the lines or by populating the quickfix or location lists. The
function that retrieves the line numbers is also provided for low-level
access.


==============================================================================
2. Commands

These commands all operate on the current buffer. Excepting
|:PyCoverageClear|, they will all call |PyCoverageMissedLines| for the current
buffer and process the line numbers as appropriate.

:PyCoverageHighlight                                    *:PyCoverageHighlight*
    Uses |matchadd()| to highlight each line in the current buffer that lacks
    coverage. This uses the PyCoverageMissed highlight group, which is aliased
    to Error by default.


==============================================================================
3. Functions

PyCoverageMissedLines({buffer})                        *PyCoverageMissedLines*
    Returns the |List| of line numbers that lack coverage in the given buffer.
    {buffer} should be a valid argument to |bufname()|; it will usually be ""
    or "%" for the current buffer.


==============================================================================
4. Configuration

All configuration options have sensible defaults.

g:py_coverage_bin                                          *g:py_coverage_bin*
    This can be set to the coverage executable. Defaults to "coverage", which
    we expect to find in your path.
>
    let g:py_coverage_bin = '/usr/local/bin/coverage'
<
g:py_coverage_dir                                          *g:py_coverage_dir*
    Set this to the directory that contains the .coverage file with coverage
    data. If this is unset, we'll search for it up the directory tree from the
    target file.
>
    let g:py_coverage_dir = expand('~/')
